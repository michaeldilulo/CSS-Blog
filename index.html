            <p>In September of 2019, I was doing some research in Software Development. I have always wanted to get
                into this field I thought. Just a few weeks before I had spoken to one of my buddies who went through
                the course and he really enjoyed it. I was incredibly excited to start this journey. I made the phone
                call
                and got in touch with their Recruiter, who directed me to the CEO for the whiteboard (Technical
                challenge).
                Now, I walked in, ready to rock and roll thinking I had grasped the concept of programming through all
                the
                Udemy videos I had watched. The CEO took me into a room with the awful dreadful whiteboard, and asked me
                to
                solve a challenge, that I could with ease now, but had some hiccups along the way. The one thing that
                really
                saved my butt and got me into this course, was the ability to explain what I was thinking and it made
                sense.
                It was on that day I was officially accepted into the program to start 4 November 2019. Still, to this
                day,
                although I have not found a job yet, with COVID 19 taking off, was hands down the best decision I have
                made. This course for me started right after my drill weekend, and for those individuals out there who
                feel like they cannot balance it, trust me it can be done.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>During my time preparing for the bootcamp, I was directed to use the courses on Free Code Camp and the
                different
                sections. This site at the time was non user friendly and really didn't teach a whole lot as far as
                programming
                goes. It wasn't until the middle of my cohort that the course was upgraded and made it a much better
                user
                experience. Now (September) I have actually gone into Free Code Camp, completed the first 4/5 projects
                and still
                use it for a good reference. I definitely recommend using Free Code Camp now for preparation before
                starting to
                get into a bootcamp. The second thing I would recommend is going to https://www.udemy.com and picking up
                a
                course on there that's based off full stack web developement. Just to see and have an idea of how things
                flow.
                The big take away from this is, if you decide to go with a full stack course on Udemy, ensure that it is
                a vue.js
                full stack application course with node.js and MongoDB. Basically building MEVN projects. Also, you need
                to do
                your research on the MVC(Model-View-Controller) pattern, because while the first week might seem like a
                breeze, MVC
                is a foreign concept to people and it can make the course really difficult. In time you will grasp it
                because you will
                use it everyday from then on out, but it is really important to see if you can understand the pattern
                the best you can
                before entering into the course. Stay tuned as I will talk about my experience through this bootcamp
                with as much as I can recollect from it. I should have started this back when I went through the course,
                but in Full Stack Development, you are busy, programming everyday. So you will have to excuse me if any
                of the content is fuzzy with the details.
