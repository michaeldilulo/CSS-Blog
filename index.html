            <div class="date"> <strong>Software Developer Bootcamp</strong></div>
            <h1>Initial Entry: Prior to class</h1>
            <p class="quote">"Hardware: The only part of a computer that you can KICK"
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>For years, as long as I can remember, I wanted to get into the world of Software Development. I had the
                exciting
                opportunity to learn mySQL back in 2015, and at that point, I realized how powerful a programming
                language really
                was. From that day on after sitting down with a co worker and got the crash course, I decided to do my
                own
                research. I looked up different programming languages, projects that I could build. I wanted to do it
                all. I
                remember writing something in my console and it said "Hello World", and I was so excited that I got it
                to work.
                Than one day in 2019, I decided to do some research on the different bootcamps around town and came
                across one in
                particular that a friend of mine had attended and absolutely loved. I sat down with him and had
                Starbucks coffee,
                I was a beer drinker at the time, but coffee seemed appropriate for the situation at hand. He had told
                me about
                his job experience now, what he was doing and how his personal experience was at the bootcamp. So I
                decided to
                give the recruiter a call, who is such an amazing person and full of personality and decided to chat
                with her about
                what my options were and if this was even something for me. The moment I sat down and talked to her, was
                the moment
                that would have changed my life, forever. Before I get started on this blog, I really want to give a big
                shoutout to
                the instructors, the CEO and most of all the recruiter for giving me such a great opportunity.

        <div>
            <p>Now, when I attended this bootcamp for Software Development, it was by no means an easy breezy course.
                This course required
                a lot of work from the students. New topics were learned every single day, along with having projects
                and checkpoints on
                the weekends. I went through it single, so it was easier for me to balance. Students in my class who
                were married and had
                lives outside of this bootcamp made it work and did the best they could to balance the situation at
                hand. A lot of my cohort
                friends have gone on to work at different companies, and continuing to do great things in the world of
                Software
                Development. This will be focused on more personal experience that I went through, along with some
                prepping tips and tricks.
                Now a days there is more content available that I didn't have when I went through (for the most part) on
                Udemy. I am excited
                to dive in and share my experience about this with you guys, along with sharing some tips and tricks
                along the way to be
                successful.

            <div class="date"> <strong>October 2019</strong></div>
            <h1>Preparation for the Bootcamp</h1>
            <p class="quote">"By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail" -Benjamin Franklin</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>At the time back in October of 2019, there was not a whole lot we could do to prepare. There was one
                program that we were
                directed to prepare with, and that was Free Code Camp. During the cohort, at the beginning of 2020, Free
                Code Camp was
                updated and it made for a better user experience. The first two sections, and the main sections that I
                would focus on to
                prepare for class is the Responsive Web Design, along with the JavaScript section. Those two things will
                be your bread and
                butter as you go throughout the course. Even now a days, I still refer to them when I need to. Reponsive
                Web Design goes over
                HTML and CSS, while the JavaScript section goes over JavaScript. Which is the primary language you will
                use during the course.
                I actually have gone back and completed 4/5 projects on the Responsive Web Design Section, and will
                complete the projects in the
                JavaScript section as well. These projects are designed to showcase what you have learned for the
                section and there is one or two
                user stories that you will have to research and learn about. The last one I have not completed yet is
                the portfolio page. I will
                dive back in sometime in the next week or so, and really finish that up. The first 5 projects you
                build(portfolio being the 5th)
                can get you headed in the right direction to a career in Software Development. While these projects use
                HTML and CSS, and
                are probably not the best, or most fun projects, the concepts are there. A topic I will be talking about
                in this is SCRUM / Agile,
                but what to know now, is that product owners get with the SCRUM masters, who really are designed to keep
                the team on track, and
                get all the user stories and make sure the programmers produce what the client wants. You can always
                dive in and learn
                more in Free Code Camp,
                but those two are what I would recommend starting off as far as preparation goes.

        <div>
            <p>The second program I want to talk about for learning is Udemy. Typically if you are a first time user,
                there are sales on courses
                that drop them from $200.00 / course to $10.00 / course. Ten dollars a course! What a steal. A couple of
                the videos I picked up
                before hand was the Full stack web development course by Colt Steele, along with the course by Angela
                Yu. Both courses have
                their fair share of projects to complete, and plenty of code along projects for grasping and
                understanding concepts that you
                have learned. During these courses, it can be easy to get frustrated, there is no need to get
                frustrated, as we were all in
                your shoes once. Everybody had to start somewhere, and the same struggle you have, is one we have shared
                in the past. Do not
                get down on yourself, keep your head up, and sometimes the best way to learn, is by failing. This is the
                start of your career
                change, the start of your life. Take the time to learn the concepts and grasp them moving forward.
                Another course that you can
                pick up for free is "Your last intro to programming" by Boise Codeworks. If you are considering a career
                change and want to
                attend their bootcamp, this course is such a great way to get started. It is free, and does not have to
                be completed all at
                once. It was not until about midway through that this course was published, and I definitely wish they
                would have had the
                course before I got started. From day one in this bootcamp you are fingers to the keyboards, and
                programming. It is definitely
                important to take the time and sit down, even if it is for 30 - 60 uninterrupted minutes a day and learn
                something new. Or refresh
                up on previous content. During the course you will realize that some students grasp the concepts better
                than others, and while
                you are struggling, never get down on yourself. The reason I keep reiterating this is because the next
                week, you will learn a new
                concept and it will just click, and the students from the week before will struggle. It is a bumpy ride,
                but always remember it
                will be worth it in the end. Pro tip, always remember, just because these courses are at normal price
                now for
                $200.00, does not mean they will be forever. Keep an eye out on the website for sales and deals. The
                majority of them come around the holidays.

            <p>The last program that I want to talk about for preparing is Edabit.com. This website has coding
                challenges in different
                languages. The main one you will need to focus on is JavaScript. I have started from the Very Easy
                section and am
                making my way through them one by one. I typically enjoy sitting down and completing a challenge before
                I start any
                project building. That way, it gets the mind thinking, and gets you in the right zone for the project
                you want to
                complete. In the Udemy course "Your last intro to Programming" by Codeworks, it talks about environment
                setup,
                connecting to Github, and using Git for source control. So you can save and push your commits. This will
                give you a
                reference point if you get stuck on a problem, and give you something to refer to. Edabit.com is one of
                the best
                websites that has challenges to do for free, when you are able to. I prefer to do one a day, sometimes
                two, or I will
                go on a tangent (like I did last night) and complete like 10-15. I do plan on building a project to
                showcase my JavaScript
                solutions to individuals out there. My hope is that I get people to comment on it, talk about solutions,
                what the thought
                process was for solving them, connecting with others and collaborating. Getting your environment setup
                will be pertinent
                moving forward. Showing off your skills, and pushing commits. It shows employers that you are active,
                and honestly makes
                for a great laugh, when you go back to one of your old projects and go.. "WTF was I thinking?". Seeing
                your progression
                from when you first started until the present, is a great way to show off where you came from, and what
                you are doing
                now. One last thing to keep in mind before we dive into the details, is when you graduate from this
                program, you are going
                to have that mindset of doing anything and everything. It is really important to stay on track and
                really go back and sharpen
                your skills that you have. Without further or do, I am excited to share my experience with you, and some
                helpful tips and
                tricks along the way to be successful. So, lets get started.
